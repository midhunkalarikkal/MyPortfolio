            I joined the <span className="text-green-400">Brototype</span> bootcamp to sharpen and shape my programming skills for the future. During this journey, I gained more than just technical knowledgeâ€”I developed discipline, consistency, strong work ethics, and a powerful mindset rooted in the principle that perception equals freedom. The program follows a research-driven, self-learning approach where I receive weekly feedback and reviews from professional software engineers through mock interviews. Each week presents a new challenge, including reading, building projects, giving seminars, and more. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping me into the person and programmer I am today.
